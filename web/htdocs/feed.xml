    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been in the web game for quite a while.  Started in grade school on
Angelfire, moved up from HTML 2.0, through 3.2 and the dHTML days.  I learned
Javascript.  I learned CSS 2.0, then 2.1, then 3.0</p>

<p>I survived the browser wars.</p>

<p>I've been writing the same Javascript over and over again, from project to
project.  It's wasteful, and it's sad, but no more.  Now it's time to
unleash <strong>lens.js</strong>.</p>

<p>There are lots of frameworks out there, but too many of them assume you
don't know what you are doing and attempt to isolate you from the browser.
They erect a big old software wall and say <em>you can play in here, but not
out there.</em>.</p>

<p>I want a framework that lets me experiment, to try out new things.</p>

<p>To that end, <strong>lens.js</strong> is built to:</p>

<ol>
<li>stay out of the way</li>
<li>help, not hinder</li>
<li>provide small, sharp tools</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get involved, head over to <a href="https://github.com/huntprod/lensjs">Github</a> and check out the
code.</p>

<p>To get started using <strong>lens.js</strong>, check out the
<a href="/docs">documentation</a>.</p>]]></content>
