I've been in the web game for quite a while.  Started in grade school on
Angelfire, moved up from HTML 2.0, through 3.2 and the dHTML days.  I learned
Javascript.  I learned CSS 2.0, then 2.1, then 3.0

I survived the browser wars.

I've been in the web game for quite a while.  Started in grade school on
Angelfire, moved up from HTML 2.0, through 3.2 and the dHTML days.  I learned
Javascript.  I learned CSS 2.0, then 2.1, then 3.0

I survived the browser wars.

I've been writing the same Javascript over and over again, from project to
project.  It's wasteful, and it's sad, but no more.  Now it's time to
unleash <strong>lens.js</strong>.

There are lots of frameworks out there, but too many of them assume you
don't know what you are doing and attempt to isolate you from the browser.
They erect a big old software wall and say <em>you can play in here, but not
out there.</em>.

I want a framework that lets me experiment, to try out new things.

To that end, <strong>lens.js</strong> is built to:

  1. stay out of the way
  2. help, not hinder
  3. provide small, sharp tools

If you want to get involved, head over to [Github][gh] and check out the
code.

To get started using <strong>lens.js</strong>, check out the
[documentation][docs].
